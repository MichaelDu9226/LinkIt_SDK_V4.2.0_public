 * @{
 * This document include all APIs for sleep tracker.
 * @addtogroup ST
 * @{
 * This document mainly introduce all details about the ST APIs including terms and acronym,
 * supported features, software achitechture, how to use this APIs, ST function groups, all enum, structure and functions.
 *
 * @section Terms_Chapter Terms and acronyms
 *
 * |Terms              |Details                                                                 |

 * |\b ST              | Sleep Tracker
 * |\b SE              | Sleep Efficiency (%) is the ratio of time spent asleep (total sleep time) to the amount of time spent on bed.
 *
 * @section Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - The function can detect sleep by continuously feeding in 3-axis accelerometers data in 10-Hz sampling rate. \n
 * - SE (%) and sleep states with corresponding timestamp (AWAKE, ASLEEP, and RESTLESS) are reported if a complete sleep duration is detected. \n
 *
 * @section Usage_Chapter How to use this API
 *
 * - Use ST library \n
 *  - step1: Call #motion_st_init to intialize sleep tracking algorithm.
 *  - step2: Call #motion_st to set motion data.
 *  - step3: Call #check_sleep_results to check if sleep events are available. The return number means total available events.
 *  - step4: Allocate appropriate buffer to #get_one_sleep_result. Buffer size can be determined by #check_sleep_results.
 *           In the sample code, 100 elements are preallocated for sleep events and corresponding timestamps.
 *  - step5: Call #rearrange_queue_for_sleep to manage internal buffer in sleep tracker APIs. It must be called after full events are accessed. 
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code
 *       int ret;
 *       int result_count = 0;
 *       sensor_data_t output;
 *       int          results[100];
 *       unsigned int results_timestamp[100]; 
 *       int se;
 *       unsigned int onbed_time; 
 *       ret = motion_st_init();//initialize ST hardware, which power on ST.
 *       if (ret == SD_STATUS_OK) {
 *         // infinite-loop to set data   
 *         while (input != NULL) {
 *           motion_st( input->data->accelerometer_t.x,
 *                      input->data->accelerometer_t.y,
 *                      input->data->accelerometer_t.z, 
 *                      input->data->time_stamp); 
 *           result_count = check_sleep_results();
 *           if(result_count > 0) {
 *             // loop to get sleep events
 *             for (j=0;j<result_count;j++) {            
 *               ret = get_one_sleep_result(&sleep_evt[j], &sleep_evt_time[j]);           
 *             }
 *             // if complete frame, then cache the sleep efficiency
 *             if(ret == C_STATE) {
 *               se         = get_se();
 *               onbed_time = get_bedtime();
 *             }
 *             rearrange_queue_for_sleep();
 *           }
 *         }
 *       }        
 *    @endcode
 *
 * @section Function_Group_Chapter ST function groups description
 *
 * For easily using, we group the APIs by its functionality.
 * You can refer to the details of each function by clicking the function name.
 * - ST hardware initialization \n 
 *   #motion_st_init function mainly initialize parameters on ST.
 *   Before running ST, you should call this firstly. 
 * 
 * - Run ST \n 
 *   #motion_st function will run algorithm by assigning a set of motion value and corresponding timestamp;
 *
 * - Check results \n 
 *   #check_sleep_results can return the available number of data which can be accessed. \n
 *   System software should get data as soon as possible OR the results will be overwritten.
 * 
 * - Get results \n 
 *   System software should allocate apporiate results buffer and results_timestamp buffer before calling #get_one_sleep_result, #get_se, #get_bedtime, and #rearrange_queue_for_sleep. 
 *   #check_sleep_results can return the available number of data which can be accessed. \n
