 *
 * @section Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - Based on moton_st library, this advanced APIs can extract motion-related features for sleep staging. \n 
 *
 * @section Usage_Chapter How to use this API
 *
 * - Use ST library \n
 *  - step1: Call motion_st_init() to intialize sleep tracking algorithm.
 *  - step2: Call motion_st() to set motion data.
 *  - step3: Call #check_sleep_motion_fet to check if features are available. The return number means total available features.
 *  - step4: Allocate appropriate buffer to #get_one_motion_fet. Buffer size can be determined by #check_sleep_motion_fet.
 *           In the sample code, 100 elements are preallocated for features and corresponding timestamps.
 *  - step5: Call #rearrange_queue_for_motion_fet to manage internal buffer in sleep tracker APIs. It must be called after full features are accessed. 
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code
 *       int ret;
 *       int fet_count = 0;
 *       int          motion_fet[100];
 *       unsigned int motion_fet_time[100]; 
 *       ret = motion_st_init();//initialize ST hardware, which power on ST.
 *       if (ret == SD_STATUS_OK) {
 *         // infinite-loop to set data   
 *         while (input != NULL) {
 *           motion_st( input->data->accelerometer_t.x,
 *                      input->data->accelerometer_t.y,
 *                      input->data->accelerometer_t.z, 
 *                      input->data->time_stamp); 
 *           fet_count = check_sleep_motion_fet();
 *           if(fet_count > 0) {
 *             // loop to get motion features
 *             for (j=0;j<fet_count;j++) {            
 *               ret = get_one_motion_fet(&motion_fet[j], &motion_fet_time[j]);           
 *             }
 *             rearrange_queue_for_motion_fet();
