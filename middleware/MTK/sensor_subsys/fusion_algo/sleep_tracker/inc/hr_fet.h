 *
 * @section Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - The advanced APIs can extract HR-related features for sleep staging. \n 
 *
 * @section Driver_Usage_Chapter How to use this API
 *
 * - Use ST library \n
 *  - step1: Call #hr_fet_init to intialize HR features extraction.
 *  - step2: Call #hr_fet_ext & #resp_fet_ext to set HR and BISI data.
 *  - step3: Call #check_sleep_hr_fet to check if features are available. The return number means total available features.
 *  - step4: Allocate appropriate buffer to #get_one_hr_fet. Buffer size can be determined by #check_sleep_hr_fet.
 *           In the sample code, 100 elements are preallocated for features and corresponding timestamps.
 *  - step5: Call #rearrange_queue_for_hr_fet to manage internal buffers in HR features extraction APIs. It must be called after full features are accessed. 
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code
 *       int ret;
 *       int fet_count = 0;
 *       int          hr_fet[100];
 *       unsigned int hr_fet_time[100]; 
 *       ret = hr_fet_init();
 *       if (ret == HR_FET_STATUS_OK) {
 *         while (input != NULL) {
 *           if(input_list->sensor_type == PPG_TYPE) {
 *             hr_fet_ext(ppg_bisi_data, ppg_bisi_time, 0);
 *             resp_fet_ext(ppg_bisi_data, ppg_bisi_time); 
 *           }
 *           else if (input_list->sensor_type == BISI_TYPE) {
 *             hr_fet_ext(ppg_bisi_data, ppg_bisi_time, 1);
 *           }
 *           fet_count = check_sleep_hr_fet();             *
 *           if(fet_count > 0) {
 *             // loop to get heart rate features
 *             for (j=0;j<fet_count;j++) {            
 *               ret = get_one_hr_fet(&hr_fet[j], &hr_fet_time[j]);
